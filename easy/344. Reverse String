Problem:
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.


Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is a printable ascii character.


Solution:
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int high = s.length-1;
        int low = 0;
        char temp = 0;
        
        while (low < high) {
            temp = s[low];
            s[low] = s[high];
            s[high] = temp;
            high--;
            low++;
        }
        
        return;
    }
}
