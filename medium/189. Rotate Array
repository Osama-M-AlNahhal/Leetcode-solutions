Problem:
Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.


Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 105
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
0 <= k <= 105
 

Follow up:
Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least three different ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?


Solution:
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        k = k % nums.length;
        reverse(nums,0,nums.length-1);
        reverse(nums,0,k-1);
        reverse(nums,k,nums.length-1);
    }
    
    public void reverse(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
        int temp = 0;
        while(start < end) {
            temp = nums[start];
            nums[start] = nums[end];
            nums[end] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
}
