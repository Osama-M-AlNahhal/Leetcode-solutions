Problem: 
Given an integer num, return three consecutive integers (as a sorted array) that sum to num. If num cannot be expressed as the sum of three consecutive integers, return an empty array.

Constraints:
0 <= num <= 1015

Solution:
class Solution {
    public long[] sumOfThree(long num) {
        long output[] = new long[3];
        long counter2 = num / 3;
        long counter1 = counter2 - 1;
        long counter3 = counter2 + 1;
        
        if (counter1 + counter2 + counter3 == num) {
            output[0] = counter1;
            output[1] = counter2;
            output[2] = counter3;
            return output;
        } else {
            return new long[0];
        }     
       
    }
}
